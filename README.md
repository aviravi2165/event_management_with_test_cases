Hi,

As per the instruction on the mail I have created the Event Management APIs.

===========Important Note===========
    - I have created 2 environment in the app one for development and one for testing.
    - Develpoment Enviraonment - (npm run dev)
        I have used "nodemon" in the developent environment
    - Testing enviroment - (npm run test)
        I have used "jest" and "supertest" in the developemnt environment
    - Seeding Data - (npm run seed)
        I have created script to start the seeding process
    - I am using "env-cmd" for executing comands an environment from an env file in both prod and test environement.

===========Dependancy===========
devDependencies
     - env-cmd
     - jest - testing framework 
     - supertest - testing
     - nodemon - node restart when saved
  },
  dependencies: {
     - bcrypt: password encription
     - express: hosting server
     - express-validator: for user input validation
     - jsonwebtoken: to create a tokenizing machanism for the user who login from multiple devices
     - moment: to modify date and time formats
     - mongoose: database operations
     - multer: fileupload
     - validator: to create custom validation in the schema 
  }
